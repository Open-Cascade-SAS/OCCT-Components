## OPEN CASCADE PMI Visualization

OPEN CASCADE PMI Visualization is a specialized component that enables standards-compliant display of Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) in 3D visualization applications.

### Overview
In today's manufacturing industries, 3D digital modeling is ubiquitous, and visualization software tools are in high demand as designs need to be reviewed by numerous stakeholders. Beyond simply displaying geometry correctly, sophisticated development teams require compliant usage of information associated with 3D designs - specifically PMI (Product and Manufacturing Information).

Drawing from over 20 years of expertise in industrial 3D visualization solutions, Open CASCADE offers its proven PMI Visualization technology, ensuring that PMI representations conform to industry standards:
- Geometrical tolerancing implemented according to ISO 1101:2012
- Visualization of GD&T data in 3D scenes following ISO 16792:2015

This standards-compliant visualization guarantees digital continuity, ensuring universal symbols and styles for PMI presentations regardless of the originating software system.

### Benefits
- ISO-compliant visualization of PMI data (ISO 1101:2012 and ISO 16792:2015)
- Reduced errors through standardized interpretation of industrial data
- Enhanced collaborative capabilities for engineering teams
- Seamless integration with OCCT-based visualization applications
- Supports PMI data from multiple sources

### Features
**Comprehensive PMI Support**
Applications built with PMI Visualization effectively handle PMI data from various sources:
- PMI entities imported from STEP AP242 (ISO 10303-242)
- JT format (ISO 14306:2017)
- Proprietary CAD formats

**Supported Presentations**
PMI presentations can be created using a rich set of geometry combinations (points, lines, surfaces):
- Dimensional information:
  - Angular dimensions
  - Linear dimensions
  - Radial dimensions
  - Thickness callouts
- Tolerance and datum features:
  - Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing symbols
  - Datum reference frames
  - Feature control frames
- Notes and special notations:
  - Text annotations
  - Surface finish symbols
  - Special notations and symbols

### Implementation Examples
PMI Visualization has been successfully implemented in:
- Customer products across various industries
- DMU Reviewer — Open CASCADE's software visualization tool designed for collaborative work with massive 3D data
- CAD Assistant — Free offline viewer and converter for 3D CAD files and meshes (partial functionality), available on Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS
