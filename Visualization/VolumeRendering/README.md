## OPEN CASCADE Volume Rendering

OPEN CASCADE Volume Rendering is a specialized component that enables high-performance 3D visualization of massive volumetric data sets.

### Overview
Volume Rendering provides software solutions for 3D visualization of massive volumetric data sets based on Open CASCADE's proprietary technology. The component brings significant value to computed tomography (CT) scanner manufacturers, industrial manufacturing quality control, and research applications in fields such as geology and life sciences.

The technology allows displaying nearly unlimited industrial volumes of CT data through an advanced Level-of-Detail (LOD) approach, making it ideal for building unique CT solutions or enhancing existing software for 3D volumetric data processing.

### Benefits
- **Optimized licensing costs** through flexible licensing policies including "one-time payment" options
- **Efficient handling of huge CT data sets** thanks to proprietary visualization technology implementing Out-of-Core rendering and Level-of-Detail (LOD) approaches
- **High performance and visualization quality** with GPU-based algorithms that enable software use even on relatively modest workstations
- **Seamless integration** with other Open CASCADE platform capabilities – 3D algorithms, visualization, and data exchange
- **Reduced time to market** with support from Open CASCADE's 20+ years of industrial 3D experience
- **Hardware independence** allowing implementation across various systems without vendor lock-in

### Features
**Advanced Visualization Capabilities**
- 3D visualization of very large volumetric data sets generated by high-resolution CT equipment
- Simultaneous visualization of voxel and polygon data, including textured meshes
- Planar sections with arbitrary orientation and multi-section combinations on one or several views
- Multiple clipping modes including Boolean combinations of clipping planes
- Volume rendering transfer function for displaying and evaluating density distribution

**Enhanced Visual Analysis**
- Advanced illumination effects with deferred shading and light source management
- Improved surface texture recognition for better part shape assessment
- Detailed density analysis and distribution visualization

**Architecture and Integration**
- Open architecture for easy integration with existing systems
- Full compatibility with Open CASCADE Technology
- Extensible with custom data processing, analysis, and visualization algorithms:
  - Cavity and hollow detection
  - Density analysis
  - Object separation
  - And more

### Applications
- Non-destructive testing (NDT) in industrial manufacturing
- Quality control procedures
- Research in geology, life sciences, and similar fields
- Medical imaging and analysis
- Industrial CT data visualization and processing
